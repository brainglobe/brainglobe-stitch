Stitching tiled 3D light-sheet data in napari

----------------------------------

A [napari] plugin for stitching tiled 3D acquisitions from a [mesoSPIM] light-sheet microscope.
The plugin utilises [BigStitcher] to align the tiles and napari to visualise the stitched data.

## Installation

We strongly recommend to use a virtual environment manager (like `conda` or `venv`). The installation instructions below
will not specify the Qt backend for napari, and you will therefore need to install that separately. Please see the
[`napari` installation instructions](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html) for further advice on this.

To install latest development version:

    pip install git+https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-stitch.git

This plugin requires Fiji to be installed on your system. You can download Fiji [here](https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads).

The BigStitcher plugin must be installed in Fiji. Please follow the instructions [here](https://imagej.net/plugins/bigstitcher/#download).
